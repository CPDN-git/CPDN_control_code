Unit tests for CPDN control code
================================

Glenn Carver, CPDN, 2025.

To run the unit tests, in the main code directory (not here),
do the following steps:

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. cmake --build .
5. ctest  (or ctest -V for to see all test output)

Note that the CMakeLists.txt file does NOT build either the openifs or wrf executables.
(at least not yet)
