Unit tests for CPDN control code
================================

Glenn Carver, CPDN, 2025.

To run the unit tests, in the top directory (not in utests subdir),
do the following steps:

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. cmake --build .
5. ctest  (or ctest -V for to see all test output)

Note that the CMakeLists.txt file does NOT build the CPDN control executable.
(at least not yet)
